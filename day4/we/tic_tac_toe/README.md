# Getting Started with Create React App
![WIN_20220627_16_58_00_Pro](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97114184/176540083-829d778f-5166-4725-baf6-c1d316ae5cdf.jpg)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts
differece between props and State
Props ::::
1-Props is properties 
2- They read only components (ex-React.jsx)
3-it is an object which stores the value of attributes of a tag and work similar to html attributes
4-it is similar to function arguments


state::::
1-there are only types of state in react 
   1:useState() :-
   useState have information that you need to store 
               
useState api=
Returns a stateful value, and a function to update it.

During the initial render, the returned state (state) is the same as the value passed as the first argument (initialState).

The setState function is used to update the state. It accepts a new state value and enqueues a re-render of the component.
const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);
In the project directory, you can run:

reduce function :::
Definition and Usage. The reduce() method executes a reducer function for array element. The reduce() method returns a single value: the function's accumulated result. The reduce() method does not execute the function for empty array elements. The reduce() method does not change the original array.

example ::array.reduce(function(total, currentValue, currentIndex, arr), initialValue)


map function in react()::::
When working on React apps, you will encounter use cases where you have to deal with arrays. These cases could involve data from an external API, responses from your backend services, or, most commonly, rendering a list of data items in your component.

The map() function lets you manipulate the items in an array by iterating and accessing individual items. In this guide, you will learn how to use the map() function and export it. 

filter:::
The FILTER function allows you to filter a range of data based on criteria you define.


In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
